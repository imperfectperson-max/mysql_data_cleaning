The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, includes transaction records from an online retail store. The objective is to clean the data, remove inconsistencies, and transform it into a format suitable for analysis.\n\nObjectives:\nData Import and Exploration:\n\nImport the dataset from CSV format into a SQL-based database.\nExplore the dataset to understand its structure and identify potential issues.\nData Cleaning:\n\nRemove Rows with Missing Values: Delete records with any missing critical fields, including InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country.\nRemove Duplicate Records: Identify and remove any duplicate transactions to ensure data accuracy.\nCorrect Data Types: Ensure that fields like Quantity, UnitPrice, and CustomerID are of the correct numeric types and InvoiceDate is formatted as a date.\nData Transformation:\n\nCreate Derived Columns: Add new columns to calculate total revenue per transaction.\nParse Dates: Extract and create new columns for InvoiceYear and InvoiceMonth from the InvoiceDate.\nCategorize Prices: Create a PriceCategory column based on unit price ranges.\nHandling Special Cases:\n\nIdentify and Handle Returns: Separate negative quantity transactions (returns) into a different table for specialized analysis.\nDetect Anomalies: Identify unusual patterns such as high transaction amounts or frequent purchases by the same customer.\nData Aggregation:\n\nMonthly Revenue Analysis: Aggregate data to calculate total revenue per month and create summary tables for business reporting.\nCustomer Purchase Patterns: Analyze purchase behavior by customer, including transaction frequency and total expenditure.\nNormalization and Denormalization:\n\nNormalize Data: Separate transactional data from customer data for improved organization and analysis.\nDenormalize Data: Combine tables for easier reporting and analysis if necessary.\nPerformance Optimization:\n\nIndexing: Create indexes on frequently queried columns to improve query performance.\nData Export: Export the cleaned and transformed data for use in further analysis or reporting tools.\nDocumentation and Reporting:\n\n\n'''\nimport numpy as np  #
